# Workflow for Integrating Telegram Chat Selling with Midnight Blockchain

## User Data Shielding

### a. User Log in to the DApp

- Users access the DApp through their web browser.
- They connect to the DApp using a wallet extension (e.g., MetaMask for Midnight blockchain).

### b. Enter Private Data and Choose to Shield It

- Users enter their private data (e.g., age, origin, language) in the DApp interface.
- They choose which data to shield.

### c. Data Encryption and Storage on the Blockchain

- The entered data is encrypted locally in the user's browser.
- The encrypted data is sent to a smart contract on the Midnight blockchain, which stores it securely.
- Zero-knowledge proofs are generated to validate that the data has been shielded correctly without revealing the data itself.

## Chat Sale Consent

### Storing Consent Without Private Data

- Store the consent on the blockchain through a smart contract, ensuring that no private data is shared with the backend.
- Use zero-knowledge proofs to validate the consent process, ensuring that users have agreed without revealing their private data.

## Chat Collection and Anonymization

### Processing in Private Backend

- Collect the chats from users who have given consent.
- Anonymize the chats in the private backend to ensure no identifiable information remains.

## Buyer Offers and Data Unshielding

### Unshielding Data for Specific Buyers

- A buyer makes an offer to unshield specific data (e.g., age, origin).
- The request to unshield data is managed through a smart contract.
- The user must approve the unshielding request.
- Upon approval, the data is decrypted and made available only to that specific buyer.
